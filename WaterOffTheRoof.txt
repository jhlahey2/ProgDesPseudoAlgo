ASSIGNMENT
==========
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof
and convert them to inches.
(So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240").
Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall.
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water.
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

VARIABLES
=========
integer inputLength
integer inchLength
integer inputWidth
integer inchWidth
integer inputRainfall
integer gallons
float fResult

ALGORITHM
=========
define integer inputLength for input length of roof in feet
define integer inchLength for length of roof in inches
define integer inputWidth for input width of roof in feet
define integer inchWidth for width of roof of roof in inches
define integer gallons as a constant to use in calculation
define float fResult to hold the result of the calculation

set gallons to 231

display "enter length of house in feet as an integer"
set inputLength to input
display "enter width of house in feet as an integer"
set inputLength to input
display "enter amount of rainfall in inchees as an integer"
set inputRainfall to input
set inchLength = inputLength * 12
set inchWidth = inputWidth * 12
set intResult = (inchLength * inchWidth * inchRainfall) / gallons
display The runoff is intResult gallons

    set intResult = (inchLength * inchWidth * inchRainfall) / gallons

    PRINT "The runoff is "
    PRINT intResult
    PRINT "gallons"
END


TEST
====

inputLength = 100
inputWidth = 80
inputRainfall = 5
output = The runnoff is 24935.065 gallons

inputLength = 60
inputWidth = 40
inputRainfall = 2
output = The runnoff is 2992.208 gallons
