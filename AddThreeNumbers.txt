ASSIGNMENT
==========
His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.


VARIABLES
=========
integer intFirst
integer intSecond
integer intThird
integer intResult
integer intCount

ALGORITHM
=========
define integers intFirst, intSecond, intThird, to hold the input
define integer intResult to hold the result
define integer intCount to hold the count
set intCount to 1
while intCount is less than 4 (keep asking for input)
    ask for input
    store the input in appropriate variable
    increment intCount
endwhile
add intFirst + intSecond + intThird and store the result in intResult
display the sum is intResult

PSEUDOCODE
==========

START
    DEFINE integer intInput
    DEFINE integer intResult
    DEFINE integer intCount
    SET intCount = 1
    SET intResult = 0
    WHILE intCount < 4
        display "please enter integer" = intCount
        intInput = INPUT
        intResult = intResult + intInput
        intCount = intCount + 1
    ENDWHILE
    PRINT "the sum is " = intResult
END


TEST
====

Input = 8
Input = 9
Input = 10
intResult = 27
Output = the sum is 27

Input = 83
Input = 2
Input = 5
intResult = 90
Output = the sum is 90
